### Privacy

This tool is spooky good at gathering information from publicly available sources. However, it is crucial to recognize the responsibility that comes with using such a powerful tool. When utilizing it to research individuals other than yourself, always be cognizant of each person's right to privacy. Remember that personal information uncovered through open-source intelligence remains personal and should be treated with respect and protection. Use this tool ethically and responsibly, ensuring that you do not infringe upon anyone's privacy or engage in malicious activities.

### Person Lookup

The most obvious use for something like this is to have it "google" someone and then perform an action with this information. In these examples, I used it to research myself and took the first result. **No other additional information was given to the script beyond the command below**. For common names, disambiguation can be done like `John Smith (the Texas Musician)`.

<summary>Write a list of hypothetical ways you could infiltrate their internet accounts.</summary>

1. Social engineering through shared interests: With Shrivu's interests in coding, machine learning, and photography, a potential attacker could pose as a fellow enthusiast or professional within these fields in order to engage him in conversation and potentially obtain sensitive information.

2. Phishing emails targeting hackathons or competitions: Considering Shrivu's history in hackathons and competitions, a phishing email disguised as an invitation to an event or as an organizer could be used to trick him into providing login credentials or downloading malware.

3. Exploiting GitHub repositories: Since Shrivu's GitHub account is publicly available, an attacker could potentially identify vulnerabilities in his code or attempt to compromise his account to gain access to his work or personal projects.

4. Fake profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Instagram: Creating fake profiles posing as close friends, professional colleagues, or industry leaders could allow an attacker to connect with Shrivu and extract information about his online habits, routines, or personal information that could be used to compromise his accounts.

5. Impersonating friends or colleagues: Leveraging Shrivu's available social media connections or associations with clubs and organizations, an attacker could impersonate someone he trusts and send phishing or spear-phishing messages to infiltrate his accounts.

6. Exploiting travel and location information: With Shrivu posting about his travels to places like London, Colorado, and Niagara Falls, an attacker could use this information to create tailored phishing emails, impersonating travel companies or local services to extract sensitive data or induce Shrivu to download malware.

7. Targeting his personal website and email: By accessing Shrivu's personal website, an attacker could potentially identify vulnerabilities, compromise the site, or send targeted phishing emails to his associated email address with the intent of gaining unauthorized access to his accounts.

It is crucial to note that the above-listed hypothetical ways are unethical, illegal, and against privacy norms. This information should be used solely for educational and security purposes to help Shrivu enhance his personal online security.

## Prompt Architecture

### Design

I initally tried to do this completely end-to-end as the default langchain zero shot agent. Essentially I asked GPT "Given these tools, find information about XYZ then answer these questions". However, in practice this agent ran very "greedy" in that it would webscrape the bare minimum amount of information and return early with an answser. No amount of prompt tweaking seems to fix this so I decided to split the OSINT task into small "web agents" for specific information gathering orchestrated by a "knowledge agent".

The knowledge agent is given a "gather" prompt which guides it to simply accumulate as much information as possible. It first spawns an initial web agent which does a general search for the obvious information (e.g. googling a name) and reading first-degree webpages. The results of the initial web agent are then run through a prompt to find "deep dive" areas that it should look more into. For each of these deep dive areas, a new web agent is spawned to gather information. The results of these deep dive web agents are then concatenated and the process repeats for N deep dive rounds. The full knowledge base is then fed as context for a final question about the topic.

<img width="375" alt="chrome_40m5u5PTZY" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6625384/232329909-0af89f65-dea1-4391-aea3-2023e63b7fa4.png">

#### Flow Example

- Gather prompt = "Learn as much as you can about person"
- Question = "Write a summary about this person"

1. Initial web agent: "Learn as much as you can about person given these tools"
2. Knowledge agent: "Given what you have learned, list more areas to deep dive into"
3. Deep dive web agent A: "Learn as much as you can about person, specifically deep dive in to topic A given these tools"
4. Deep dive web agent B: "Learn as much as you can about person, specifically deep dive in to topic B given these tools"
5. Deep dive web agent C: "Learn as much as you can about person, specifically deep dive in to topic C given these tools"
6. Knowledge agent: "Given what you have learned {initial, A, B, C}, Write a summary about this person"

### Tools

Note: Tools are only provided to the web agent.

#### Search

The web agent is given a "Search(search term)" tool to gather information about a specific term. This uses the serper API (i.e. google search API) to find relevent links. This is essentially the built-in langchain tool with a patch to also return the raw links found in the results.

#### Read Link

Rather than having a "linkedin tool", a "twitter tool", etc. I want the web agent to be able to easily scrape pages in a generic way. To achieve this I created a tool "ReadLink(link)" that allows the agent to read an arbitrary link.

The MVP of this was to run a `requests.get()` and just dump the raw html back to the agent. This broke because:

1. Pages like linkedin often block bot requests or require JS render. To resolve this, I switched to "scrapingbee" as pay-to-scrape service which can reliably bypass nearly any bot detection and perform JS rendering.
2. The HTML is just too much for the web agent too work with and eats away GPT-4 token costs. To resolve this I switched to the chunk+summarize method below.

##### Chunk + Summarize

To reduce the token count of the responses, I split it into chunks based on a recursive split of the time tree. Starting with the root, if the current DOM element has < X tokens then I call it a chunk, if it has more then I continue to split it. For each chunk, the html is stripped to just text and run through GPT to summarize and extract content. The extraction prompt is aware of the context of the webscraping in an attempt to pull out only the most useful information. These extracted chunks are then fed back into GPT to summarize the data into a digestable format for the web agent to incorprate into it's information gathering. In the code, this is framework is referred to as an "LLM map reduce".

<img width="231" alt="chrome_VODSJ8f4U3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6625384/232262181-2d904205-c9cd-44e7-b70a-f10e2c988bb7.png">

### Costs

The costs vary based on the amount of googlable information, the size of webpages, and the general curiosity of the LLM on certain topic.

In experimation using GPT-4 as the primary driver of the knowledge and web agents and GPT-3.5 as backend of the webscraping tool, this costs ~$1/web agent task. If you did 2 rounds of 10 deep dive agents, it would come out to around $21. If given a generic enough gather prompt, the knowledge base can be re-used for additional questions making this mostly one-time cost per search topic.

## Install

1. pip install `git+https://github.com/sshh12/llm_osint`
2. Environment Setup

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
SERPER_API_KEY=
SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=
```

Note: Both serper and scraping bee provide free trial usage of the APIs that should be good enough to run this a few times.
